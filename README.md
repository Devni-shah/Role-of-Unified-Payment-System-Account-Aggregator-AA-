  - Understand the mechanisms behind secure data retrieval, processing, storage, and sharing.
- **Regulatory Framework Evaluation:**  
  - Assess the RBI’s guidelines and compliance requirements for AAs.  
  - Examine the balance between fostering innovation and ensuring robust data protection.
- **Strategic and Competitive Analysis:**  
  - Utilize strategic frameworks like SWOT, PESTEL, and Porter’s Five Forces to evaluate the AA sector.  
  - Identify key strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats that shape the industry.

### 3. Methodological Approach
- **Literature Review and Data Collection:**  
  - Conduct an extensive review of academic journals, industry reports, and case studies on open banking and account aggregation.  
  - Gather insights through interviews with industry leaders and analysis of real-world case studies from prominent AA companies.
- **Analytical Techniques:**  
  - Apply strategic frameworks to assess competitive dynamics and market trends.  
  - Perform comparative analyses between traditional banking models and account aggregation services.

### 4. Key Themes and Findings
